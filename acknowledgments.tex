I would like to express my profound gratitude and appreciation to Ayellet and Lihi for their advisment,
guidance and support in the process of conducting and completing this research. 
They had pushed me to produce better results than I had ever imagined possible, and without their belief in me, this research would have produced mediocre results instead of the work I am proud to present here.
 
I would also like to thank Dr. Uri Wollner for countless hours spent in train rides and on weekends, providing invaluable advice during the process of producing this work, my lovely spouse, the Dr. Hilla Ben-Hamou, who had to endure with me this whole time,  and finally to my fellow researchers in the Technion and CGM lab, for the fun and helpful atmosphere, you have made my time enjoyable and fruitful.

This research was supported by the Israel Science Foundation under Grants 1089/16 and 1083/18 and
